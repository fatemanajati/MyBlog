          <h1><i>A little bit about The Kingdom of Bahrain:</i></h1>
          <p>
            Bahrain originally means "Two Seas". Today, Bahrain's "two seas" are generally taken to be the bay east and west of the island, 
            the seas north and south of the island, or the salt and fresh water present above and below the ground. Bahrain is a tiny island placed between the Qatar peninsula and the north eastern coast of Saudi Arabia.
             The capital and biggest city in Bahrain is Manama, ruled by his Majesty Shaikh Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa. The population of Bahrain is over 1.2 million with 600,000 non nationals.
             This small island is known for it's vast majority of oil and petrol findings, with Bahrain ranking the most humid and hot country reaching to 
             38 degrees in August and coming down to 14 degrees in January. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bahrain#Etymology" target="_blank">(More on wikipedia)</a>

          <h1><i>24th Arabian Gulf Cup:</i></h1>
          <p>
            During the start of December 2019, The GCC countries were participating in a football match to win the Gulf cup. This football match takes
            place every three to four years between the Khaleeji countries. It had been 50 years since Bahrain won this Gulf Cup, However, it all changed on the 8th of December 2019,
             it was marked the day of happiness in Bahrain and in history as the supporters were filled with joy for their dear country.  National football team
            had their last match taking place at Doha's Khalifa Stadium, Qatar. After the match finished and the referee finally blew the whistle,
            the streets in Bahrain were filled with cars and Bahraini Flags, music and celebration. This continued until our beloved team members came back the next day from Doha 
            and we had the chance to celebrate the achievement with them at the Bahrain International Circuit (BIC).

            <h1><i><span style="color: red;">16th December 2019</span></i></h1>
              <p>
                  Although 14 August is the actual date on which Bahrain gained its independence from the British, the kingdom does not celebrate or mark that date. Instead, the state annually celebrates 16 December as National Day,
                   to coincide with the day that former ruler Isa bin Salman Al Khalifa ascended to the throne. As such,
                   16 December is a national holiday and is usually celebrated with firework displays <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_Day_(Bahrain)" target="_blank">(More on wikipedia)</a>. These photos were taken by me and my friends during the holidays leading upto Bahrain's National day
                  which takes place on the 16th of december every year. Its the time where everyone celebrates our Independance Day by 
                  having fireworks at the Bahrain International circuit (BIC), where we also have concerts and races taking place every year
                  during the winter, right around March/April.

            <h1><i>My Never-ending love for Classic Cars</i></h1>
            <p>
              The old American Muscle 1980's cars hold a big place in my heart. I've always loved these cars from the start, right when i knew a 
              thing or 2 about them. They look so breathtaking on the road and never run out of style! 
              For some reason, the way they were built back in the day allowed them to be great long-lasting cars that are still in use
              in this day and age.container<br>
              My uncle has a wide range of classic cars in his house and i'm always fascinated everytime i visit! I guess little things like this 
              tend to run in the family as he inherited this feature from his father, who is my Grandfather and he loved old collections of Jaguars and
              Chevy's.
